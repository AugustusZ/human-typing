# TypeScript React Starter

```bash
yarn && yarn start
```

Note: using `npm i && npm start` is also fine but it will return a warning which is coming from npm itself (https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/15708).

This is a starter repo

* of React and TypeScript
* linting with [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint)
